This project was inspired by [@clowrey](https://github.com/clowrey) and his project here: https://github.com/clowrey/esphome-esp32-2424s012-lvgl-powermeter/ (which is greatly inspired by [@clydebarrow](https://github.com/clydebarrow)).

I've taken @clowrey's ["powermeter"-example](https://github.com/clowrey/esphome-esp32-2424s012-lvgl-powermeter/blob/main/esp32-2424s012-lvgl-powermeter-test.yaml) and I've made a (consumption) powermeter that reads from Home Assistant and display the current power usage, usage today (kWh and cost) and usage this month (kWh and cost).
